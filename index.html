<b>Abstract</b> <br>
<strong>Distributed systems</strong> are ubiquitous and their implementation is complex and error-prone. 
In order to check for errors, they can be modeled as systems of <strong>communicating automata</strong>, 
where each automaton represents the behavior of an element of the system. Verification 
problems such as reachability are undecidable in such a model. Indeed, a system of 
communicating automata is Turing-equivalent. For that, the use of approximations is 
necessary. <strong>k-synchronizability</strong> is one of these techniques. A system is k-synchronizable if, 
for all executions, there is an equivalent execution that can be divided into phases 
containing k messages. These phases are called k-exchanges. In this thesis, we analyse 
k-synchronizable systems: we show that reachability is decidable and we are interested 
in the membership problem, that is: given a system, decide whether it is k-synchronizable. 
We study both the case where k is an input of the problem, and the case where we have to 
guess a k such that the system is k-synchronizable. We study them according to the <strong>type 
of communication</strong> of the system. Either the system is in mailbox and so each process 
has only one buffer to store all received messages, or the system is in peer-to-peer, 
and each process has a buffer for each sender. Both problems are decidable when the system 
is communicating in mailbox. When the system is communicating in peer-to-peer, the first one 
is decidable and the second remains open. Finally, we point out some counter-intuitive cases 
of k-synchronizable systems that lead us to propose some variations to the definition of 
k-synchronizability. A comparative study of the state-of-art classes of systems and our new 
classes concludes our work.
