<b>Abstract</b> <br>
    Most of the <strong>distributed systems</strong> we use nowadays are based on the
message-passing paradigm where systems are structured into parties that
interact only by sending/receiving messages. Message-passing programming is
largely employed in high performance computing (MPI, OpenMP, etc), event-driven
applications built on top of actor-based languages (Scala, Erlang,etc),
service-oriented architectures, peer-to-peer applications, etc. Unfortunately,
because of the variety of <strong>communication models</strong> (peer to peer, mailbox, etc.), of
the ambiguities of the specifications of the communication primitives, and of
the difficulty of running representative tests, etc., it is error prone and
therefore often reserved to experts. The majority of the issues above stem from
the asynchronous nature of messages exchange. Indeed, the conception and the
analysis of message-passing programs is greatly simplified if one can assume
that all communications occur synchronously, i.e., that each message is received
exactly at the same time it has been sent. As a matter of fact, some properties
(e.g., reachability) becomes decidable if the underlying communication model is
synchronous. We are thus interested in understanding under which conditions we
could avoid using asynchronous models and being able to design and prove correct
simpler but equally powerful systems. This is a property that goes under the
name of <strong>synchronizability</strong>. Synchronizability of a distributed system is the
property that the observable behaviour of the system is the same whether or not
the communications are synchronous. The main topic of my PhD is to develop
methods and tools that help designing safe distributed systems based on the
notion of synchronizability.</div>
